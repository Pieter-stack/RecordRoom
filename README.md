<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project

![image1][image1]

### Project Description
This app is designed and developed to play music. It allows the user to interact with the typical music player features like; pause, play, rewind & forward songs. Record Room gives the user the ability to search for albums and also to filter through it by genre. 

Record Room also offers other music player functions like adding albums you like to your favourites, easier access to your favourite songs that have been added to your “Favourite Playlist”. The app showcases all the artists songs in one of their albums which allows the user to have a detailed album view. 

Record Room has a settings page that gives the user a short description of the app and who the Developer is. Also on the settings page is a button that allows the user to toggle between the option of Lightmode or Darkmode. 

Lastly Record Room combines a bit of the retro-looking theme with 21st century modern and sleek theme to give a new overall appealing aesthetic differentiating it from all of the other music player apps out there.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the backend of the application.

### Implementation Process

#### Design Architecture
`React native` to design the pages used in Topshots.

#### Highlights

* One highlight was to `research`  music and find different ways of implementing music within the app.
* The `UI/UX design` was designed for the user to quickly find all of the music on one page.
* The best part was to load the app onto a `real device` and play music from the app.

#### Challenges

* Was a challenge to find and setup sound and music within the project but at the end everything worked out good.

#### Future Implementation

* Add `more music` to the app.
* Have cooler `music` integrations.
